	<h2>Humans Need Not Apply</h2>

	<p>In this documentary they describe how humans create machines to reduce human labor. These robots aren't stupid machines doing what they have been programed to do, these robots that reduce labor for humans are getting smarter and replacing humans in almost all fields. Writing, paperwork and decision making are now transferring to humans to robots. A range of workers are replaced by .... ROBOTS </p>

<p>Robots, as a hip person might say, these robot are scary AF. They can easily replace us, at anything. They don't need us humans to make them smarter, because they make themselves smarter. It is also fun to think about because we don't have to work as hard and we can work in art and food and clothes for an example, like the renaissance. I personally am not feared by this because were not dumb enough to let robots take too much control. Robots can help humanity and working alongside them would be beneficial. Robots should replace world leaders and greedy higher ups that control peoples lives, because robots aren't greedy. With robots in power we don't have to protest and such because our leader would be perfect. I feel that many people fear robots because of the movies but if they look at them as help we can all be on the same page. If animals, humans and robots can all work together, then this world will never end, might possibly extend to other planets.

	<h3>The Comments</h3>
	<h4>Justin Siguachi</h4>
	<p>After reading Xavier's review on the video "Humans Need Not Apply" I agree with his argument. Robots won't never actually take over us no matter how advanced they get because humans aren't as stupid. Technology can be used for the better by helping communities connect with eachother and using it to expend our knowledge on things. Good Job Xavier.</p>

		<h2> Blown To Bits</h2>

		<p>Fingerprints and footprints- We leave a trail of what we do when we access the internet</p>
<p> smile while we snap- Technology such as cameras being on phones, help us day to day and mostly help catch criminals.</p>
<p> knowing where you are-GPS helps people especially when hiking up a mountain because of the GPS</p>
<p>Technology is a crazy thing. It protects us and also stalks us and knows too much information about us. More information then we actually know about ourselves. But on the other side its very useable and convenient.</p>

<p> I was 11 when I got my first computer. It was a Packard Bell.</p> 

<p> Growing up my favorite piece of technology was the VCR.</p> 

<p> Technology has made life easier and difficult at the same time. I grew up with a rotary phone, then went to a touch-tone phone, to a cellular phone (which only made phone calls), to a cellular phone in which the primary function is not necessarily to make phone calls anymore. </p> 

<p>They have hurt society more than help. iPhones are practical but it has made life difficult because I prefer texting over talking, buying songs in a cloud as opposed to owning a physical cassette/cd, I also don’t have phone numbers memorized anymore.</p> 

<p> My greatest hope for technology in the future is that humans can start using other methods of transportation. Even if cars are powered by hydrogen or electricity over oil, cars are still ancient. </p> 

<p> My greatest fear for technology in the future is that their less empathy and socializing. Technology makes it very easy humans to stay indoors and keep to themselves. </p> 

<p> My greatest advice to the younger generation is to push the boundaries of technology by thinking aloud. You might think your ideas will be considered silly or get laughed at but no idea is original and you might find people that agree with you more than you think. </p> 
<p>Also, future-proof yourself with the devices you buy. Ultimately, you’re just buying time before upgrading your device.</p>
<p> I love technology because it’s tangible proof of how far humanity has come along.</p>
